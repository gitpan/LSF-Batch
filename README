LSF::Batch - Access Platform Computing's LSF (Load Sharing Facility) Batch API

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the first version of this library. Most of the functions in the 
API have been implemented, but only a few have been tested, as you can
see from the test.pl. 

If you are interested in contributing at this point, you can:

1: Write some more tests so I can get this whole thing tested.
2: Flesh out the interfaces to a few calls that I haven't implemented
   yet.
3: If you have ideas for improving the "perlishness" of the interface
   chime right in.

Notes:

I've only tested this on an IBM AIX 4.3.2 machine running perl 5.00403.
It should be easily portable. I've built this to work with LSF 4.0. It 
should be easy to get it to work with earlier versions of LSF, but I 
haven't done that yet.

You'll need to edit the Makefile.PL so it can find your version of the
LSF includes and libraries.

History:

Version 0.01 4/04/2000:

First public release. Some functions not totally debugged and not
completely tested.

Version 0.02 4/05/2000:

Forgot to add this README to the MANIFEST. How silly of me!
