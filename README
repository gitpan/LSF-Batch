Most of the functions in the API have been implemented and work,  but
the formal test.pl is pretty skimpy. We've been using it now for
production work, so it's starting to get a workout.

If you are interested in contributing at this point, you can:

1: Write some more tests so I can get this whole thing tested.
2: Flesh out the interfaces to a few calls that I haven't implemented
   yet.
3: If you have ideas for improving the "perlishness" of the interface
   chime right in.

Notes:

This now works on both Solaris 2.6 and AIX 4.3. It's still very much alpha.

Thanks to Jim Meyer of Platform Computing for the updated Makefile.PL.

Contributions are always welcome.
